                    The Bijou is located at 30330 Gaujac, Department of Gard in the Languedoc-Roussillon. Gaujac is a very tranquil village surrounded by vineyards and orchards. 
                    It has its own chateau (privately owned and open to visitors), its own wine producers (visits and tastings are highly recommended) and even La Maison, 
                    an excellent restaurant mentioned in the Michelin Guide. Gaujac is situated 10kms south of Bagnols-sur-Ceze and 15kms north of Remoulins on the RN86.

                    A short 15 minute drive to the west will take you to the exquisite town of Uzes, France's oldest Duchy.
                    Take in the sights, smells and sounds of the colourful Wednesday and Saturday morning market 
                    then enjoy a drink at the many charming outdoor cafes in the Place aux Herbes.
                </p>
                <p>There are plenty of festivals of dance, theater, music, pottery, truffles, harvesting, gardening and antiques. Chateauneuf du Pape, Avignon, Nimes, Orange and the Gorge de l'Ardeche are half an hour away. The golden Mediterranean beaches are within an hour’s drive.</p>
                <p>A trip to the tallest Roman Aqueduct the Pont du Gard, will take just 20 minutes. Whilst there, don't forget to look in at the museum, which will explain as much as you could wish to know about the history of this incredible monument, constructed to carry water across the river Gard on its way from Uzes to Nimes. The Pont du Gard is the second most photographed site in France, after the Eiffel Tower.</p>
                <p>Chateauneuf du Pape is the jewel in the crown of the Cotes du Rhone wine region, where you can partake of a degustation (tasting) at many of the caves in the village - with no obligation to buy. 30 minutes drive.</p>

                <p>Why not take a drive to the Gorges de l'Ardeche and experience some breathtaking scenery and maybe a spot of lunch under the shade of a mulberry tree?</p>
                <span>Orange also has some spectacular Roman monuments including this incredible theatre which stands 38 metres high and 103 metres long. It is the most beautiful and best conserved antique theatre on earth and hosts fantastic operas and all sorts of music concerts.</span>
                <p>Take a look at the Triumphal Arch which was constructed during the period of Augustus and has also been well preserved.</p>
                <p>Avignon has the famous festival each summer in July and the Palais des Pape is a must see. Maybe take a boat trip down river and check out the Pont St-Benezet (Pont d'Avignon). Wander the streets within the walled city then enjoy lunch from a bewildering choice in the buzzing Place de l'horloge.</p>
                <p>The Roman presence in Nimes is everywhere, nowhere more so than the Arenes and the Maison Carree, right in the centre of the town. These remarkably well preserved monuments were constructed under Augustus over 2000 years ago. Don't miss Les Jardins de la Fontaine.</p>
                <p>You can reach the Camargue in about an hour. Experience the spectacular bird life and perhaps see the famed wild white horses, pink flamingos and the occasional bull.</p>
                <p>Call in at Arles on the way back and have a look at the Roman theatre, amphitheatre and the museum of ancient history. Be aware at Easter and the first week of September when they have "Bull running" in the streets preceding each Corrida.</p>
                <p>The Dutch impressionist Van Gogh lived at Arles and completed much of his better known work here. The town is justifiably proud of its artistic cultural links displaying much of Vincent's presence here. Oddly, none of his works are on display at Arles!</p>
                <p>Golf, kayaking, swimming, hiking, cycling, tennis, nature walks and wine tastings are amongst the more popular pursuits in the region.</p>
                <p>Near Gaujac you will find four of the officially nominated “Ten most beautiful villages of France” (Aigueze, La Roque sur Ceze, Montclus and Lussan).</p>
