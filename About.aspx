                    The Bijou has been designed to comfortably accommodate four adults. 
                    <br />
                    is a non-smoking villa and no pets are allowed as 3 pussy cats are living next door. 
                    <br />
                    We regret that the villa is not wheelchair friendly and a car is highly desirable (available to rent at airports and TGV stations).
