                <p>
                    The Bijou is an elegant villa located within the extraordinary beauty, tranquillity and opulence of Languedoc Roussillon, France.
                <p>
                    The Bijou is an independent dwelling with its own gates, driveway, parking for 3 cars and entrance door. The owners live conveniently next door and are therefore available to offer help and suggestions to maximise your holiday experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Relax, barbecue and dine alfresco under the magnificent 300 year old oak tree after an energetic game of Petanque!
                <p>
                    The views are spectacular with a different stunning twilight every evening as the sun sinks behind the Oppidum (Roman ruins), bathing the villa in a golden glow. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a 10m x 5m floodlit swimming pool adjoining the covered terrace with a further sizeable sun terrace, equipped with sun beds and parasol, directly outside the salon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Bijou has been designed for comfort and relaxation. It has been built to a very high specification, incorporating numerous authentic Provencal features such as exposed 
                    reclaimed beams and roof tiles, combined with the needs of modern living like double glazed windows and under-floor heating and cooling. It is decorated with art collected 
                    by the owners who travelled all over the world the last 30 years.

                <p>Our rental includes the exclusive use of the swimming pool, the grounds adjacent to the villa including the boules/petanque court, all bed, bath and kitchen linens and pool towels.</p>
                <p>
                    On request we will gladly shop for your first necessity before your arrival.
                    <br />
                    Bookings for the Gaujac restaurant ‘La Maison’ need to be made well in advance.
                    <br />
                    Should you wish to enjoy manicure, pedicure, head massage, it can be arranged for you.
                    <br />
                    Chauffeur driven tours can be arranged (wine tastings, visit to festivals, etc).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Bijou has been designed to comfortably accommodate four adults. 
                    <br />
                    It is a non-smoking villa and no pets are allowed as 3 pussy cats are living next door. 
                    <br />
                    We regret that the villa is not wheelchair friendly and a car is highly desirable (available to rent at airports and TGV stations).
